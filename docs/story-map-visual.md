## Key Insights

### 1. Dependency Flow
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- No phase can start without its dependencies
- Critical path is clear: Auth → Providers → Programs → Search → Payments

### 2. MVP Definition
- True MVP is achieved at end of Phase 5
- Includes: User auth, provider catalog, search, and payments
- Everything after Phase 5 is growth/optimization

### 3. Risk Areas
- Phase 3-4 transition: Ensuring enough content for search
- Phase 4-5 transition: Payment integration complexity
- Phase 6: Provider adoption of self-service tools

### 4. Parallel Work Opportunities
- Within Phase 2: Auth and Admin can progress in parallel
- Within Phase 3: Provider management and catalog structure
- Within Phase 6: Portal, communications, and suggestions
- Within Phase 7: Analytics, mobile, and AI features

## Recommended Adjustments

### 1. Create Missing Issues
- Security, SRE & Observability stories (currently missing)
- Proactive suggestions epic and stories
- Booking system stories for MVP

### 2. Reassign Issues to Correct Milestones
- Move provider portal stories from Phase 5 to Phase 6
- Move core search features to Phase 4
- Ensure payment system is in Phase 5 for MVP

### 3. Update Epic Numbers
- Clarify Epic 6 duplication (catalog vs payments)
- Properly number and organize all epics
- Ensure consistent epic references across documents
