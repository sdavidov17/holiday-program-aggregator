3. Create sprint planning templates based on new phases

### Technical Preparation:
1. Set up Stripe test account for Phase 4
2. Prepare provider onboarding materials for Phase 3
3. Design preference schema for Phase 5 proactive features

## Success Metrics

### Phase Success Criteria:

- **Phase 6**: <2s average search response time

### Risk Mitigation:

- Monitor technical debt throughout all phases

## Conclusion

The milestone reorganization creates a more logical development flow that ensures each phase delivers value while building toward a complete MVP. The visual story map provides clear guidance for development teams, and the updated GitHub structure aligns with actual implementation needs.
