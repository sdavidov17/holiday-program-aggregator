# Epic 3, Story 3.2: Proactive Email Generation

## User Story
**As the** system  
**I want** to generate a personalized list of programs for each user  
**So that** they can receive a relevant, curated email with suggestions

## Epic
Epic: #4 (Proactive Suggestions & User Preferences)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A backend process can be triggered for a specific user or batch of users
2. The process:
   - Retrieves the user's saved preferences
   - Identifies the upcoming school holiday period
   - Queries for matching programs within preferences
   - Applies smart ranking algorithm considering:
     - Distance from preferred locations
     - Match with activity preferences
     - Age appropriateness
     - Previous engagement (if available)
     - Program popularity
3. Compiles a list of top 5-10 matches
4. Handles edge cases:
   - No preferences set (use defaults)
   - No matches found (expand search criteria)
   - Insufficient matches (include "similar" programs)
5. Generates email-ready data structure
6. Process is idempotent and can be re-run safely
7. Performance: Can process 1000 users in <5 minutes
