# Epic 4, Story 15: Simple Monitoring Dashboard (Free Tier Addition)

**Story:** *As a team member, I want a basic monitoring dashboard, so that I can see system health at a glance.*

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Real-time health status display
2. Error rate trends (24h/7d)
3. Basic performance metrics
4. Recent alerts and incidents
5. Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Create Next.js dashboard page
- [ ] Build health status components
- [ ] Implement metrics aggregation
- [ ] Add WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Deploy as internal tool

## Dependencies

- Story 4.5: Health Checks (status data)
- Story 4.2: Structured Logging (metrics source)
- Story 4.13: Basic Alerting (alert history)

## Estimated Effort

- **Development:** 4 days
- **Testing:** 1 day
- **Documentation:** 0.5 days

## Implementation Notes

### Dashboard Components

1. **System Health Overview**
   - Service status (UP/DOWN)
   - Last check timestamp
   - Uptime percentage

2. **Error Metrics**
   - Error rate graph (24h/7d)
   - Error breakdown by type
   - Top error messages

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time (P50, P95, P99)
   - Request volume
   - Database query time

4. **Recent Activity**
   - Last 10 alerts
   - Recent deployments
   - Active incidents

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js page with React components
- **Backend:** API routes for metrics aggregation
- **Real-time:** WebSocket for live updates
- **Storage:** In-memory cache for recent metrics

### Access Control
- Protected route requiring authentication
- Admin-only access initially
- Consider read-only access for team

### Mobile Considerations
- Responsive grid layout
- Touch-friendly controls
- Reduced data on mobile

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Dashboard page created and accessible
- [ ] All metrics components functional
- [ ] Real-time updates working
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Performance optimized (<2s load)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Team trained on dashboard usage
