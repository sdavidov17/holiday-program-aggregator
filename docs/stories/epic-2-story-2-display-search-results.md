# Epic 2, Story 2.2: Display Program Search Results

## User Story
**As a** subscribed parent  
**I want** to see a list of programs that match my search criteria  
**So that** I can quickly scan the available options

## Epic
Epic: #3 (Parent-Facing Search & Discovery)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A search queries the database for vetted, published providers matching all applied filters
2. A paginated list of matching programs is displayed with key information:
   - Provider name and vetted badge
   - Program title and brief description
   - Age range
   - Dates/schedule
   - Price range
   - Location/distance
   - Activity type icons
3. A user-friendly "no results" message is shown if no matches found
4. Search results load within performance standards (<2 seconds)
5. Results can be sorted by:
   - Distance (default)
   - Price (low to high, high to low)
   - Age suitability
   - Dates
6. Pagination shows 20 results per page with infinite scroll on mobile
7. Each result card is clickable to view details
