# Epic 0, Story 3: Database Schema & Initial Models

**Story:** *As a developer, I want a well-designed database schema so that we can efficiently store and query application data.*

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database schema designed for core entities
2. User model with authentication fields
3. Provider model with required fields
4. Program model with relationships
5. Database migrations configured
6. Type-safe database queries

## Implementation Summary
- Prisma ORM configured with SQLite for development
- Ready for PostgreSQL migration for production
- Core models implemented:
  - User (with NextAuth integration)
  - Account (OAuth providers)
  - Session management
  - Verification tokens
- Type-safe database access with Prisma Client

## Schema Design
```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  email         String?   @unique
  emailVerified DateTime?
  image         String?
  accounts      Account[]
  sessions      Session[]
}

model Account {
  // OAuth account details
}

model Session {
  // Session management
}
```

## Technical Decisions
- **ORM**: Prisma for type safety and migrations
- **Development DB**: SQLite for simplicity
- **Production DB**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS ready
- **ID Strategy**: CUID for distributed systems
