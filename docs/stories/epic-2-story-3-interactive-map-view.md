# Epic 2, Story 2.3: Interactive Map View

## User Story
**As a** subscribed parent  
**I want** to see the program results plotted on a map  
**So that** I can understand their proximity to me at a glance

## Epic
Epic: #3 (Parent-Facing Search & Discovery)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All programs in the current search results are displayed as interactive pins on a map
2. Map pins show different states:
   - Default state
   - Hover state with preview
   - Selected/active state
3. Clicking/tapping a map pin:
   - Highlights the corresponding program in the list view
   - Shows a popup with key program details
   - Provides link to full details
4. The map automatically centers and zooms to show all results
5. Users can freely pan and zoom the map
6. Map includes standard controls:
   - Zoom in/out
   - Reset to results view
   - Toggle to fullscreen
   - Current location button
7. Clustering is applied when many programs are in close proximity
8. Map performs smoothly with up to 200 pins

## Technical Tasks
- [ ] Integrate mapping library (e.g., Mapbox, Google Maps)
- [ ] Create custom map pin components with provider branding
- [ ] Implement pin clustering algorithm
- [ ] Build map-list synchronization logic
- [ ] Add map controls and interactions
