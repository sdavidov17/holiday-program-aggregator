## BDD Scenarios

### Feature: Payment Processing Test Coverage
```gherkin
Feature: Payment Processing Test Coverage
  As a parent
  I want reliable payment processing
  So that I can purchase subscriptions without issues

  Background:
    Given the Stripe test environment is configured
    And test payment methods are available

  Scenario: Successful subscription purchase
    Given I am a logged-in parent
    And I have selected the "Premium" subscription plan
    When I enter valid payment details
    And I submit the payment form
    Then my payment should be processed successfully
    And I should receive a confirmation email
    And my subscription should be active

  Scenario: Payment failure handling
    Given I am attempting to purchase a subscription
    When my payment is declined
    Then I should see a clear error message
    And I should be able to retry with different payment details
    And no subscription should be created

  Scenario: Webhook processing
    Given a Stripe webhook event is received
    When the event type is "customer.subscription.created"
    Then the subscription should be activated in our database
    And the user should be notified
    And audit logs should be created

  Scenario Outline: Subscription lifecycle events
    Given a subscription exists
    When a <webhook_event> is received
    Then the subscription status should be <new_status>
    And appropriate actions should be taken
    
    Examples:
      | webhook_event | new_status |
      | customer.subscription.updated | updated |
      | customer.subscription.deleted | cancelled |
      | invoice.payment_failed | past_due |
```

### Feature: E2E Parent Journey
```gherkin
Feature: Complete Parent Journey
  As a parent
  I want to find and book holiday programs
  So that my children have activities during school holidays

  Scenario: Complete booking journey
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I search for "sports" programs in "Sydney"
    Then I should see relevant search results
    When I click on a provider
    Then I should see the provider details
    When I click "Get Started"
    Then I should be prompted to sign up
    When I complete registration
    And I select a subscription plan
    And I complete payment
    Then I should have access to all features
    And I should receive a welcome email
```

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests (Priority 1)
- [ ] **Subscription Service Layer:**
  - `createSubscription()` - Test all subscription tiers
  - `updateSubscription()` - Test upgrades/downgrades
  - `cancelSubscription()` - Test cancellation flows
  - `handleWebhook()` - Test all webhook events

- [ ] **Repository Layer:**
  - `BaseRepository` - Test CRUD operations
  - `ProviderRepository` - Test search queries
  - Transaction handling and rollbacks
  - Query optimization tests

- [ ] **Payment Processing:**
  - Stripe customer creation
  - Payment method handling
  - Subscription lifecycle
  - Error scenarios

### Integration Tests (Priority 2)
- [ ] **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/stripe/webhook` - All event types
  - `POST /api/subscription/create` - All plans
  - `GET /api/provider/search` - Various filters
  - Authentication middleware

- [ ] **Database Operations:**
  - Transaction integrity
  - Concurrent access handling
  - Data consistency checks

### E2E Tests (Priority 3)
- [ ] **Critical User Journeys:**
  - Parent registration → subscription → provider search → booking
  - Provider onboarding → profile setup → program creation
  - Admin login → provider review → approval/rejection
  - Search filters → results → provider details → contact

### Performance Requirements
- Page load: < 3 seconds
- API response: < 200ms (p95)
- Database queries: < 100ms (p95)
- Concurrent users: 100+

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] CSRF token validation
- [ ] Rate limiting (10 req/sec per IP)

## Technical Design

### Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Critical business logic (Payment, Subscription, Repository)
2. **Phase 2**: E2E customer journeys
3. **Phase 3**: Security and performance testing
4. **Phase 4**: Test infrastructure improvements

### Components/Modules

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Test database setup
CREATE DATABASE holiday_aggregator_test;

-- Test user with limited permissions
CREATE USER test_user WITH PASSWORD 'test_password';
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE holiday_aggregator_test TO test_user;
```

### Test Data Management
```typescript
// Test Factory Example
export const createTestProvider = (overrides?: Partial<Provider>) => ({
  id: faker.datatype.uuid(),
  businessName: faker.company.name(),
  email: faker.internet.email(),
  isVetted: true,
  isPublished: true,
  ...overrides
});

// Seed data for E2E tests
export const seedE2EData = async () => {
  await prisma.provider.createMany({
    data: testProviders
  });
};
```

### Dependencies

## QA Results
**Review Date**: 2025-08-14
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Senior QA Architect)

### Critical Findings:
1. **Current Coverage**: 23.42% (CRITICAL - Must reach 80%)
2. **Zero Coverage Areas**: Payment, Subscription, Repository layers
3. **Missing E2E Tests**: Only 2 basic tests exist
4. **No Security Testing**: OWASP requirements not met
5. **No Performance Testing**: Despite defined benchmarks

### Recommendations:
- Immediate implementation of payment/subscription tests
- E2E coverage for all critical user journeys
- Security test suite implementation
- Performance baseline establishment

### Risk Assessment:
**CRITICAL**: Current test coverage poses significant production risk. Implementation should begin immediately.
