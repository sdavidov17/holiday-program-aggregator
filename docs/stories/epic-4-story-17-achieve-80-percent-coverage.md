## STORY 4.17: Achieve 80% Test Coverage Target

### Story Description
As a development team, we need to improve our test coverage from the current ~31% to meet the 80% target as defined in our Definition of Done, ensuring comprehensive testing of all implemented features.

### Milestone
**Phase 3: User Experience** - Due: September 30, 2025

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Line coverage reaches 80% or higher
- [ ] Branch coverage reaches 80% or higher  
- [ ] Function coverage reaches 80% or higher
- [ ] Statement coverage reaches 80% or higher
- [ ] All critical business logic has corresponding tests
- [ ] No reduction in existing test quality
- [ ] Jest configuration updated to enforce 80% thresholds

### Technical Details

#### Current State
- Line coverage: ~30.78%
- Branch coverage: ~23.98%
- Function coverage: ~22.38%
- Statement coverage: ~30.97%
- 178 tests passing, 34 skipped for unimplemented features

#### Areas Needing Coverage
Based on coverage report, priority areas include:
1. **Pages** (0% coverage):
   - `/pages/index.tsx`
   - `/pages/profile.tsx`
   - `/pages/test-login.tsx`
   - `/pages/admin/*`
   - `/pages/auth/*`
   - `/pages/subscription/*`

2. **API Routes** (low coverage):
   - `/pages/api/admin/*`
   - `/pages/api/auth/*`
   - `/pages/api/health/*`
   - `/pages/api/debug/*`

3. **Services** (partial coverage):
   - `subscription-lifecycle.ts` (8.19%)
   - `email.ts` (36.36%)

4. **Utilities** (partial coverage):
   - `encryption.ts` (0%)
   - `monitoring.ts` (0%)
   - `auditLogger.ts` (35.71%)

#### Test Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Focus on business logic, utilities, and services
2. **Integration Tests**: API routes and database operations
3. **Component Tests**: React components and pages
4. **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys (already in separate suite)

### BDD Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Coverage Thresholds Met
```gherkin
Given the test suite is run with coverage
When the coverage report is generated
Then line coverage should be >= 80%
And branch coverage should be >= 80%
And function coverage should be >= 80%
And statement coverage should be >= 80%
```

#### Scenario 2: Critical Business Logic Tested
```gherkin
Given a critical business function (e.g., subscription processing)
When tests are written for this function
Then all happy paths should be tested
And all error conditions should be tested
And edge cases should be covered
```

#### Scenario 3: Component Testing
```gherkin
Given a React component with user interactions
When component tests are written
Then all props variations should be tested
And all user interactions should be simulated
And accessibility requirements should be verified
```

### Implementation Tasks
1. [ ] Analyze current coverage report in detail
2. [ ] Prioritize untested critical paths
3. [ ] Write unit tests for utilities and services
4. [ ] Add integration tests for API routes
5. [ ] Create component tests for pages
6. [ ] Update Jest thresholds to 80%
7. [ ] Document testing best practices
8. [ ] Set up coverage trend tracking

### Dependencies
- Jest and React Testing Library already configured
- Coverage reporters in place
- CI/CD pipeline configured for test reporting

### Estimated Effort
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Points**: 8
- **Duration**: 1 sprint

### Definition of Ready
- [x] Coverage report available showing gaps
- [x] Test infrastructure in place
- [x] Acceptance criteria defined
- [x] BDD scenarios documented

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code coverage >= 80% across all metrics
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] Test documentation updated
- [ ] Coverage report published
- [ ] Team trained on new test patterns

### Notes
- Current 34 skipped tests are for unimplemented features and should remain skipped
- Focus on testing implemented features first
- Consider test performance impact on CI/CD pipeline
- May need to refactor some code for better testability
