## Implementation Steps

1. **Run the script** to create missing issues and update assignments
2. **Update PRD** to match GitHub epic structure
3. **Communicate changes** to all stakeholders
4. **Update project board** to reflect new organization
5. **Review and adjust** sprint planning accordingly

## Risk Mitigation

- **Content Risk**: Ensure enough providers/programs are loaded in Phase 3 for meaningful Phase 4 testing
- **Integration Risk**: Start Stripe integration early in Phase 4
- **Adoption Risk**: Plan provider training for Phase 5 rollout
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate 20% of each phase for refactoring and debt reduction

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Clear Dependencies**: Each phase builds logically on the previous
2. **True MVP**: Phase 4 delivers a complete, launchable product
3. **Growth Path**: Phases 5-6 focus on scaling and optimization
4. **Risk Reduction**: Critical features are implemented in logical order
5. **Parallel Work**: Within each phase, teams can work on multiple epics
