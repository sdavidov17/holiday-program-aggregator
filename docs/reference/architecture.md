# Fullstack Architecture Document: Holiday Program Aggregator

### **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Holiday Program Aggregator, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

* **Starter Template or Existing Project**
    * **Recommendation:** This project will be initialized using the **"T3 Stack"**.
    * **Rationale:** This starter provides a production-ready, scalable, and type-safe foundation that directly aligns with our selected technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS). Its inclusion of tRPC and Prisma will significantly improve developer experience and code quality, while the pre-configured NextAuth.js will accelerate the implementation of our required social logins.

### **High Level Architecture**

* **Technical Summary:** The architecture will be a modern, full-stack, serverless web application built on the T3 Stack. It leverages Next.js for the frontend and tRPC for a type-safe API layer, housed within a Turborepo monorepo. The system will be deployed on Vercel for seamless integration and scalability, with a PostgreSQL database managed by a service like Supabase or Neon.
* **Platform and Infrastructure Choice:**
    * **Platform:** **Vercel**.
    * **Key Services:** Vercel Serverless Functions, Vercel Edge Network, and a managed PostgreSQL provider (e.g., Supabase, Neon).
    * **Regions:** Database hosted in **ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)**.
* **Repository Structure:**
    * **Structure:** **Monorepo**.
    * **Tool:** **Turborepo**.

        V_API --> Email;
    ```
* **Architectural Patterns:** Jamstack Architecture, Serverless Functions, Repository Pattern (with Prisma), and API Gateway Pattern (implicit via Next.js/Vercel).

### **Data Models**

*Includes the detailed models and TypeScript interfaces for Provider (with SafetyChecks), User, Program, and Subscription.*

### **API Specification**

*Includes the tRPC router definitions for `providerRouter` (searchPrograms, getProgramById), `userRouter` (getProfile, updatePreferences), and `subscriptionRouter` (createCheckoutSession, getSubscriptionStatus).*

### **Unified Project Structure**

*Defines the monorepo folder structure using Turborepo, with an `/apps/web` directory for the Next.js application and a `/packages` directory for shared code (api, db, ui, config).*

### **Development Workflow**

*Outlines the steps for local setup (prerequisites, install commands) and the core development commands (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`, etc.). Includes a template `.env.example` file with required environment variables for database, authentication, and NextAuth.js.*

### **Checklist Results Report**

* **Executive Summary:** The Fullstack Architecture Document has been validated and is **Ready for Development**. The architecture is sound, pragmatic, and well-aligned with our MVP goals.
* **Final Decision:** âœ… **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**

### **Next Steps**

The completed PRD and this Architecture Document should now be handed to the **Product Owner (PO)** to be "sharded" into smaller pieces for the development team. Following that, the **Story Manager (SM)** can begin creating the first story from Epic 1 for implementation.
