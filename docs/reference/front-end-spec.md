# UI/UX Specification: Holiday Program Aggregator

### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

* **Target User Personas:**
    * **Primary Persona: "The Urban Professional Parent"**. This user is time-poor, digitally savvy, and values convenience, quality, and trust above all else. The entire user experience will be tailored to their needs.
* **Usability Goals:**
    * **Efficiency:** A user must be able to go from opening the application to viewing a relevant, vetted program in under 60 seconds.
    * **Confidence:** The design must instill a sense of trust and safety at every step.
    * **Clarity:** The interface will prioritize clarity, ensuring a stressed parent can easily understand and navigate the options.
* **Design Principles:**
    1.  **Trust Above All:** Every design decision must support user confidence.
    2.  **Frictionless Flow:** Remove every possible point of friction.
    3.  **Curated, Not Cluttered:** Present a manageable list of options, not an overwhelming directory.
    4.  **Provide Instant Feedback:** Every user action must have an immediate and clear visual response.

### **Information Architecture (IA)**

* **Site Map / Screen Inventory:**
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        subgraph Public Area
            A[Homepage / Landing Page] --> B(Login / Sign-up);
        end

        subgraph Authenticated User Area
            B --> C{Authentication Check};
            C --> D[Search & Map Interface];
            D --> E[Program Details Page];
            D --> F[User Profile];
            F --> G[Edit Profile];
            F --> H[Preferences];
            F --> I[Billing & Subscription];
        end

        subgraph Admin Area
            J[Admin Login] --> K[Admin Dashboard];
            K --> L[Provider Management];
            K --> M[Crawl Management];
        end
    ```
* **Navigation Structure:**
    * **Primary Navigation (for logged-in parents):** `Search Programs`, `My Profile`, `Log Out`.
    * **Secondary Navigation (within `My Profile`):** `Edit Profile`, `My Preferences`, `Billing & Subscription`.
    * **Breadcrumb Strategy:** Used on nested pages like the Program Details page (e.g., `Home > Search Results > Program Name`).

### **User Flows**

* **Flow 1: New User Onboarding & First Search**
    * **User Goal:** To sign up, pay for a subscription, and successfully find their first relevant holiday program.
    * **Flow Diagram:**
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[Visit Homepage] --> B[Click "Sign Up"];
            B --> C{Choose Method};
            C --> D[Email/Password];
            C --> E[Google Login];
            C --> F[Apple Login];
            D --> G[Enter Details & Submit];
            E --> G;
            F --> G;
            G --> H[Show Subscription Page];
            H --> I[Enter Payment Details];
            I --> J{Payment Success?};
            J -- Yes --> K[Show "Set Preferences" Onboarding];
            J -- No --> L[Show Payment Error & Retry];
            L --> I;
            K --> M[Save Preferences];
            M --> N[Redirect to Search Page];
            N --> O[View Pre-Filtered Results];
        ```
    * **Edge Cases:** Payment Failure, Social Login Failure, User Skips Preferences.

### **Wireframes & Mockups**

* **Primary Design Files:**
    * **Design Tool:** Figma is recommended.
    * **Link:** [Placeholder for the link to the final Figma file]
* **Key Screen Layouts:**
    * **Screen: Search & Map Interface:** A two-panel layout on desktop (Left: filters/results, Right: map). On mobile, this will be a single, toggleable view between List and Map.
    * **Screen: Program Details Page:** A clean, single-column layout with a hero image, header section, body content, and a prominent "Trust & Safety" section. A sticky call-to-action button will be used on mobile.

### **Component Library / Design System**

* **Design System Approach:** For the MVP, we will create a small, internal component library using **Storybook** to develop and document components in isolation.
* **Core Components:**
    * **Button:** (Variants: Primary, Secondary, Text Link; States: Default, Hover, Disabled, Loading).
    * **Input Field:** (Variants: Standard, Password, with Icon; States: Default, Focused, Error, Disabled).
    * **Program Summary Card:** (States: Default, Hover).
    * **Map Pin:** (Variants: Standard, Highlighted; States: Default, Hover/Selected).
    * **Vetting Status Badge:** (Variants: "Vetted & Verified," "Pending Verification").

### **Branding & Style Guide**

* **Color Palette:** Primary: `#005A9C` (Deep Blue), Secondary: `#F0F4F8` (Light Grey-Blue), Accent: `#F5A623` (Warm Orange). Includes standard functional colors for success, warning, and error states.
* **Typography:** Primary Font Family: **"Inter"**. A clear type scale is defined for H1, H2, H3, Body, and Small text.
* **Iconography:** Icon Library: **Heroicons**. Outlined icons for standard display and solid icons for active/selected states.
* **Spacing & Layout:** A standard **8-point grid system** will be used for all spacing.

### **Accessibility Requirements**

* **Standard:** The application will adhere to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.
* **Key Requirements:** This includes meeting color contrast ratios (4.5:1), ensuring full keyboard navigability, providing clear focus indicators, using semantic HTML with proper labels and alt text, and ensuring touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels.
* **Testing Strategy:** A combination of automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse), manual keyboard testing, and periodic screen reader testing.

### **Responsiveness Strategy**

* **Breakpoints:** A standard four-breakpoint system will be used (Mobile <768px, Tablet 768px+, Desktop 1024px+, Wide 1280px+).
* **Adaptation Patterns:** The layout will fluidly adapt. The Search & Map interface will be a two-panel layout on tablet and wider, and a toggleable single view on mobile. Navigation will collapse to a "hamburger" menu on smaller screens.

### **Animation & Micro-interactions**

* **Motion Principles:** All animations must be **Purposeful, Responsive, Subtle, and Respect User Preferences** for reduced motion.
* **Key Animations:** Subtle transitions on button states, fade-in/out on filter application, slide-in for mobile panels, and loading skeletons for data fetching.

### **Performance Considerations**

* **Performance Goals:** Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds, interaction response under 100ms, and animations at 60 FPS.
* **Design Strategies:** Implementation of image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading of assets, and efficient state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

    1. Final approval of this UI/UX Specification.
    2. Begin creating high-fidelity visual designs in Figma.
