# **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Holiday Program Aggregator, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

* **Starter Template or Existing Project**
    * **Recommendation:** This project will be initialized using the **"T3 Stack"**.
    * **Rationale:** This starter provides a production-ready, scalable, and type-safe foundation that directly aligns with our selected technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS). Its inclusion of tRPC and Prisma will significantly improve developer experience and code quality, while the pre-configured NextAuth.js will accelerate the implementation of our required social logins.
