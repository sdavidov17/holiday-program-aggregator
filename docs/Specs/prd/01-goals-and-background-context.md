### **Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

* Validate a subscription-based business model for a niche, high-value market segment.
* Become the most trusted and convenient platform for parents to discover and vet school holiday programs.
* Significantly reduce the time and stress parents experience during holiday planning.
* Build a scalable platform that can expand into adjacent markets (e.g., after-school activities) in the future.

#### **Background Context**

This document outlines the requirements for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to address a critical gap in the Australian market. Busy, "Urban Professional Parents" currently lack a centralized, trusted, and efficient way to find and book holiday activities for their children. This PRD details a premium aggregator service that will solve this problem through a curated, well-vetted selection of programs and a seamless, user-centric web experience.
